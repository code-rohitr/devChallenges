The Demo shows the complete user story. The demo site is responsive to all mobile devices. "Animate on Scroll(AOS) library" has been used to add animation on the different components. Animation has also been added to the main image and the header which is visible when the page loads. The checkboxes can be checked if the user has the respective ingredients.
