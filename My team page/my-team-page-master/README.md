Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

<!-- - Where can I see your demo? -->
- The demo has been deployed using Netlify and is publicly visible through the following link: https://myteampage-code-rohitr.netlify.app/

<!-- - What was your experience? -->
-  Completing this challenge was fun for me as it involved the usage of a few properties that i hadn't used for some time. I could implement some additional CSS to make UX better for any visitor

<!-- - What have you learned/improved? -->
- As mentioned above I got to use some properties that i used after some time. This challenge helped me to recapitulate properties and their implementation.

<!-- - Your wisdom? :) -->
- The Challenge was perfect for a beginner frontend developer.

<!-- ### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) -->

## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

- Apart from the given design, I have added additional html pages for each person. 
- The additional html pages contain the picture of the person with a greeting message and a button to navigate back to the home page. 
- Cards on the main page containing the picture of the individuals have a hover effect on them. 
- The cards also show a fade animation on page load. 
- The buttons on the individual html pages also have a hover effect. 

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/hhmesazsqgKXrTkYkt0U) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.
